### üì¢ New Win & Mac Desktop Version Released - Welcome to Test and Provide Feedback [Documentation is slightly outdated, continuously updating]

 ## Project Introduction  

Krillin AI is an all-in-one audio-video localization and enhancement solution. This simple yet powerful tool integrates video translation, dubbing, and voice cloning, supporting both landscape and portrait format outputs to ensure perfect presentation across all major platforms (Bilibili, Xiaohongshu, Douyin, WeChat Channels, Kuaishou, YouTube, TikTok, etc.). Through an end-to-end workflow, Krillin AI transforms raw materials into polished, ready-to-use cross-platform content with just a few clicks.

## Key Features:
üéØ **One-Click Launch**: No complex environment setup required, automatic dependency installation, ready to use immediately. New desktop version makes it even more convenient!

üì• **Video Acquisition**: Supports yt-dlp downloads or local file uploads

üìú **Accurate Recognition**: High-precision speech recognition based on Whisper

üß† **Smart Segmentation**: Uses LLM for subtitle segmentation and alignment

üîÑ **Term Replacement**: One-click replacement of domain-specific terms

üåç **Professional Translation**: LLM-based paragraph-level translation maintains semantic coherence

üéôÔ∏è **Voice Cloning**: Offers curated CosyVoice tones or custom voice cloning

üé¨ **Video Synthesis**: Automatically handles landscape/portrait videos and subtitle layout


## Demo
The image below shows the results of importing a 46-minute local video, generating subtitle files with one click, and embedding them into the track without any manual adjustments. No missing or overlapping segments, natural breaks, and exceptionally high translation quality.

## UI Preview  
![UI Preview](/docs/images/ui_desktop.png)  

## üöÄ Quick Start  
### Basic Steps  
First, download the executable file matching your device's system from the [Release](https://github.com/krillinai/KrillinAI/releases). Follow the tutorial below to choose between the desktop or non-desktop version, then place it in an empty folder. Running the software will generate some directories, so an empty folder is easier to manage.  

„ÄêFor the desktop version (i.e., release files with "desktop" in the name)„Äë  
*The desktop version is newly released to address the difficulty beginners face in editing configuration files correctly. It still has some bugs and is being updated continuously.*  
1. Double-click the file to start using it (the desktop version also requires configuration, which is done within the software).  

„ÄêFor the non-desktop version (i.e., release files without "desktop" in the name)„Äë  
*The non-desktop version is the original release. Configuration is more complex, but it is stable and suitable for server deployment, as it provides a web-based UI.*  
1. Create a `config` folder in the directory, then create a `config.toml` file inside it. Copy the contents of the `config-example.toml` file from the source code's `config` directory into `config.toml` and fill in your configuration details.  
2. Double-click or execute the file in the terminal to start the service.  
3. Open your browser and enter `http://127.0.0.1:8888` to begin (replace 8888 with the port you specified in the config file).

### To: macOS Users  
„ÄêFor desktop version (release files with "desktop" in the name)„Äë  
Due to signing issues, the current packaging method for the desktop version does not support direct double-click execution or DMG installation. Manual trust of the application is required. Follow these steps:  
1. Open the terminal in the directory containing the executable file (assuming the filename is `KrillinAI_1.0.0_desktop_macOS_arm64`).  
2. Execute the following commands sequentially:  
   ```
   sudo xattr -cr ./KrillinAI_1.0.0_desktop_macOS_arm64  
   sudo chmod +x ./KrillinAI_1.0.0_desktop_macOS_arm64  
   ./KrillinAI_1.0.0_desktop_macOS_arm64  
   ```

„ÄêFor non-desktop version (release files without "desktop" in the name)„Äë  
This software is unsigned. On macOS, after completing the file configuration in the "Basic Steps," you need to manually trust the application as follows:  
1. Open the terminal in the directory containing the executable file (assuming the filename is `KrillinAI_1.0.0_macOS_arm64`).  
2. Execute the following commands sequentially:  
   ```
   sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine ./KrillinAI_1.0.0_macOS_arm64  
   sudo chmod +x ./KrillinAI_1.0.0_macOS_arm64  
   ./KrillinAI_1.0.0_macOS_arm64  
   ```  
   The service will then start.  

### Docker Deployment  
This project supports Docker deployment. Refer to the [Docker Deployment Guide](./docker.md).  

### Cookie Configuration (Optional)  

If you encounter video download failures,  

please refer to the [Cookie Configuration Guide](./get_cookies.md) to configure your Cookie information.  

### Configuration Help (Must Read)  
The quickest and easiest configuration method:  
* Set both `transcription_provider` and `llm_provider` to `openai`. This way, you only need to fill in `openai.apikey` under the `openai`, `local_model`, and `aliyun` configuration sections to perform subtitle translation. (`app.proxy`, `model`, and `openai.base_url` can be filled optionally based on your needs.)  

Configuration method for using a local speech recognition model (currently unsupported on macOS) (a balanced choice for cost, speed, and quality):  
* Set `transcription_provider` to `fasterwhisper` and `llm_provider` to `openai`. This way, you only need to fill in `openai.apikey` and `local_model.faster_whisper` under the `openai` and `local_model` configuration sections to perform subtitle translation. The local model will download automatically. (`app.proxy` and `openai.base_url` are the same as above.)  

The following scenarios require Alibaba Cloud configuration:  
* If `llm_provider` is set to `aliyun`, you need to use Alibaba Cloud's large model service, so the `aliyun.bailian` configuration must be filled.  
* If `transcription_provider` is set to `aliyun`, or if the "dubbing" feature is enabled when starting a task, Alibaba Cloud's speech service is required, so the `aliyun.speech` configuration must be filled.  
* If the "dubbing" feature is enabled and a local audio file is uploaded for voice cloning, Alibaba Cloud's OSS cloud storage service is also required, so the `aliyun.oss` configuration must be filled.

## Contribution Guidelines  
1. Do not submit unnecessary files (e.g., `.vscode`, `.idea`). Use `.gitignore` effectively to filter them.  
2. Do not submit `config.toml`. Instead, use `config-example.toml` for contributions.
