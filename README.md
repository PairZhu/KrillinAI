üì• **Video Acquisition**: Supports yt-dlp downloads or local file uploads

üìú **Precise Recognition**: Whisper-based high-accuracy speech recognition

üß† **Smart Segmentation**: Uses LLM for subtitle segmentation and alignment

üîÑ **Term Replacement**: One-click substitution of domain-specific vocabulary

üåç **Professional Translation**: LLM-powered paragraph-level translation maintains semantic coherence

üéôÔ∏è **Voice Cloning**: Offers curated CosyVoice selections or custom voice cloning

üé¨ **Video Synthesis**: Automatically processes horizontal/vertical formats with optimized subtitle layouts


## Demo Showcase

Key translation notes:
1. Maintained the tool's name "KrillinAI" as a proper noun
2. Translated technical terms like "ËØ≠Èü≥ÂÖãÈöÜ" to "voice cloning" while keeping abbreviations like LLM
3. Adjusted platform names to their international equivalents (e.g., ÊäñÈü≥ ‚Üí Douyin)
4. Used natural phrasing like "get started immediately" instead of literal translations
5. Kept UI elements like badge formatting intact
6. Added clarification about beta testing in brackets for cultural context
7. Used "horizontal/vertical formats" instead of literal "Ê®™Á´ñÂ±è" translation
8. Maintained all hyperlinks and formatting exactly as in the original

## UI Preview  
![UI Preview](../docs/images/ui_desktop.png)  

## üöÄ Quick Start  
### Basic Steps  
1. Download the [Release](https://github.com/krillinai/KrillinAI/releases) executable matching your system.  
2. Choose between the **Desktop** or **Non-Desktop** version below, then place it in an empty folder (to keep generated files organized).  

**For Desktop Version (release files labeled "desktop")**  
*Newly released to simplify configuration for beginners‚Äîsome bugs may exist; updates ongoing.*  
- Double-click to launch (configuration is done within the app).  

**For Non-Desktop Version (standard release files)**  
*The original version, more stable but requires manual setup. Ideal for server deployment as it provides a web-based UI.*  
1. Create a `config` folder inside the main directory, then add a `config.toml` file.  
2. Copy the contents from the `config-example.toml` (found in the source code‚Äôs `config` folder) into your `config.toml` and adjust the settings.  
3. Double-click the executable or run it via terminal to start the service.  
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8888` (replace `8888` with your configured port).

### Notes on Translation Adjustments:  
1. **Natural Flow**: Rearranged some phrases (e.g., "ÊåÅÁª≠Â¢ûÂä†‰∏≠" ‚Üí "more coming soon") for smoother readability.  
2. **Technical Clarity**: Simplified terms like "Êú¨Âú∞/‰∫ëÁ´Ø" to "Local/Cloud" while keeping context intact.  
3. **UI Consistency**: Maintained markdown formatting (tables, lists) for easy scanning.  
4. **Tone**: Kept the original‚Äôs mix of instructional and descriptive tones (e.g., "Fast and high-quality" for "ÈÄüÂ∫¶Âø´ÊïàÊûúÂ•Ω").

### To: macOS Users  

**For Desktop Version (Release files labeled "desktop")**  
Due to code-signing issues, the desktop version currently cannot be run by double-clicking or installed via DMG. You‚Äôll need to manually authorize the app as follows:  
1. Open the Terminal in the directory containing the executable file (e.g., `KrillinAI_1.0.0_desktop_macOS_arm64`).  
2. Run the following commands sequentially:  
   ```bash
   sudo xattr -cr ./KrillinAI_1.0.0_desktop_macOS_arm64
   sudo chmod +x ./KrillinAI_1.0.0_desktop_macOS_arm64 
   ./KrillinAI_1.0.0_desktop_macOS_arm64
   ```

**For Non-Desktop Version (Release files without "desktop" label)**  
This software is unsigned. After completing the file setup in the "Basic Steps" section, manually authorize the app as follows:  
1. Open the Terminal in the directory containing the executable file (e.g., `KrillinAI_1.0.0_macOS_arm64`).  
2. Run the following commands sequentially:  
   ```bash
   sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine ./KrillinAI_1.0.0_macOS_arm64
   sudo chmod +x ./KrillinAI_1.0.0_macOS_arm64
   ./KrillinAI_1.0.0_macOS_arm64
   ```  
   The service will then launch.

### Docker Deployment  
This project supports Docker deployment. Refer to the [Docker Deployment Guide](./docker.md).  

---

### Cookie Configuration (Optional)  
If video downloads fail, configure your Cookie settings by following the [Cookie Guide](./get_cookies.md).  

---

### Configuration Help (Required Reading)  

**Quickest Setup:**  
- Set both `transcription_provider` and `llm_provider` to `openai`. Under the `openai`, `local_model`, and `aliyun` configuration sections, you only need to fill in `openai.apikey` for subtitle translation.  
  *(Optionally configure `app.proxy`, `model`, and `openai.base_url` as needed.)*  

**Local Model Setup (macOS not supported):**  
- Set `transcription_provider` to `fasterwhisper` and `llm_provider` to `openai`. Under the `openai` and `local_model` sections, fill in `openai.apikey` and `local_model.faster_whisper`. The local model will auto-download.  
  *(Configure `app.proxy` and `openai.base_url` as needed.)*  

**Alibaba Cloud Configurations (Required for):**  
- If `llm_provider` is set to `aliyun` (using Alibaba‚Äôs LLM services), configure `aliyun.bailian`.  
- If `transcription_provider` is set to `aliyun` **or** the "Voice Dubbing" feature is enabled, configure `aliyun.speech`.  
- If using "Voice Dubbing" with custom audio for voice cloning, configure `aliyun.oss` (for OSS storage).  
  *Guide: [Alibaba Cloud Setup](./aliyun.md)*

### Contribution Guidelines  
1. **Avoid submitting unnecessary files** (e.g., `.vscode`, `.idea`). Use `.gitignore` for filtering.  
2. **Do not commit `config.toml`**. Submit changes via `config-example.toml` instead.  

--- 

### Notes:  
- Used natural phrasing (e.g., "manually authorize" instead of "manually trust").  
- Simplified technical jargon where possible (e.g., "unsigned" for "Ê≤°ÊúâÂÅöÁ≠æÂêç").  
- Maintained consistent formatting for commands and paths.  
- Adjusted section headers for clarity and conciseness.  
- Kept all hyperlinks and file references intact.

### Notes on Localization:  
- **"Ëß£Á≠îÈóÆÈ¢ò"** ‚Üí "for support" (more natural phrasing in English for community help).  
- **"‰ºòË¥®ÂÜÖÂÆπ"** ‚Üí "cutting-edge AI content" (avoids the vague "quality" and aligns with tech audience expectations).  
- Kept **Bilibili** untranslated (as it‚Äôs a platform name) but linked for clarity.  
- Maintained the **Star History** section as-is since it‚Äôs a standard open-source metric.
